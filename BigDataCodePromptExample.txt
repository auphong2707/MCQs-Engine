Generate 40 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in "multi" type format for Spark DataFrame API and Structured Streaming API.

Requirements:
- Each question must have "type": "multi" (even if only one correct answer)
- Balance the question type ratio (multi and single)
- Wrong options must be plausible but definitively incorrect (avoid obviously wrong distractors)
- Provide detailed explanations without citation
- Make sure options is 0-indexed
- Focus on programming task, many format of code questions, don't just spam one question format like asking API

Sample questions for reference:
[
    {
        "type": "multi",
        "question": "Which of the following code snippets are correct for creating a DataFrame with schema?",
        "options": [
            "df = spark.read.format('json').schema(mySchema).load('file.json')",
            "df = spark.read.json('file.json').withSchema(mySchema)",
            "df = spark.createDataFrame([myRow], mySchema)"
        ],
        "answer": [
            0,
            2
        ],
        "explanation": "Option 0 correctly uses the schema() method when reading JSON files. Option 2 correctly creates a DataFrame from Python objects with a schema using createDataFrame(). Option 1 is incorrect because DataFrame API does not have a withSchema() method; the correct method is schema() which must be called before load()."
    }
]

Output format: JSON array with identical structure to samples above.
