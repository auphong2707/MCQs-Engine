        "question": "In a KPI Tree, what is the primary distinction between a Leading Indicator and a Lagging Indicator?",
        "options": [
            "Leading indicators are financial metrics, while lagging indicators are operational.",
            "Leading indicators predict future outcomes and can be influenced directly, while lagging indicators confirm past performance.",

        "question": "Select all characteristics that correctly describe OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems.",
        "options": [
            "They are optimized for high-volume, small-write transactions.",
            "They typically use denormalized schemas.",
            "They are designed for fewer large reads and complex aggregation.",
