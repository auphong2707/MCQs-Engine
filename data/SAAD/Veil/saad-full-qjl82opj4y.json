        "options": ["Inception", "Elaboration", "Construction", "Transition"],
        "answer": [1],

        "options": ["Waterfall Model", "Iterative and Incremental Model", "Agile Model", "V Model"],
        "answer": [1],
        "explanation": "Iterative and Incremental development focuses on breaking a project into repeatable cycles (iterations) for gradual refinement. Unlike Agile, it does not inherently prioritize customer feedback or adaptability mid-cycle (feedback usually comes at the end)."
