        "explanation": "The CAP theorem posits that a distributed system can only simultaneously provide two out of three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. Partition Tolerance specifically means the system functions despite network failures. However, Consistency in CAP refers to strict consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time), not eventual consistency. Relational databases (RDBMS) traditionally prioritize Consistency and Availability (CA), sacrificing Partition Tolerance in a distributed context."

        "explanation": "Presto is primarily an in-memory query engine.
