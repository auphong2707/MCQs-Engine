            "Integrated; representing the differencing step.",
            "Independent; representing the lack of correlation.",

            "Inverse; representing the backshift operator."

        "answer": [0],
        "explanation": "I stands for 'Integrated', which refers to the Differencing (d) required to achieve stationarity."

        ],
