"Time series trends.",
" Geographic distribution."

"question": "If you have a Recall of 1.0 but a Precision of 0.1, what is the model doing?",
"options": [
"It is perfectly accurate.",
"It is predicting 'Positive' for almost everyone, catching all true cases but generating massive false alarms.",
"It is predicting 'Negative' for almost everyone.",
"It is broken."
],
"answer": [
1
],
"explanation": "Perfect Recall (1.0) means no False Negatives. Low Precision means many False Positives. This is typical of a 'spam all' strategy."

"$100",
"$200",
"$50",
"$1000"
],

"options": [
"It returns the first product.",
"It throws an error (in standard SQL).",
"It returns all products.",
"It returns NULL."
],
"answer": [
1
],

"The coefficient estimates are biased.",
"The standard errors of the coefficients are unreliable (affecting p-values/CIs).",
"R-squared becomes 0.",
"Predictions are impossible."
],
"answer": [
1
],
"explanation": "OLS assumes constant variance (Homoscedasticity). Heteroscedasticity doesn't bias the coefficients, but it invalidates the standard error calculations, making hypothesis tests unreliable."

"It creates new, synthetic examples of the minority class by interpolating between existing ones.",
"It duplicates existing minority rows exactly.",
"It changes the weights of the model."
],
"answer": [
1
],
"explanation": "SMOTE creates synthetic points along the line segments joining k-nearest neighbors of the minority class, adding diversity unlike simple oversampling."

"options": [
"Yes, absolutely.",
"No, the test is underpowered, and the 'significant' result has a higher probability of being a False Positive or an exaggerated effect (Winner's Curse).",
"Yes, because p < 0.05 is all that matters.",
"No, you need exactly 10,000."

"Visual deception: manipulating the scales can falsely imply correlation or intersection where none exists.",
"It uses too much ink.",
"It is always accurate."
