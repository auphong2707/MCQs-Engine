            "It is easier to calculate.",

            "It works better with small datasets."
        ],
        "answer": [1],
        "explanation": "NDCG is considered the gold standard for ranking because it applies a discount based on rank. A relevant item at Rank 1 contributes more to the score than a relevant item at Rank 10, unlike Precision which treats them equally."

        "answer": [1],
        "explanation": "The slides state that ALS (Alternating Least Squares) is used because standard Gradient Descent is difficult with Implicit Data due to the massive number of zeros (sparsity). ALS is also highly parallelizable."

        ],
        "answer": [1],
        "explanation": "Standard SARIMA looks for fixed seasonal patterns (e.g., a spike every March). It fails with Moving Holidays like Easter or Ramadan, which shift dates each year. Dynamic Regression or Prophet is needed."
